        You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines
        (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you
        lose. If you manage to click all the squares (while flagging all bombs
        by right clicking them) you win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of
        neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some
        guess work to avoid the bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square
        you think is a bomb, point and right-click.
